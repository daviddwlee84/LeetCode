# 1453. Maximum Number of Darts Inside of a Circular Dartboard

## Description

You have a very large square wall and a circular dartboard placed on the wall. You have been challenged to throw darts into the board blindfolded. Darts thrown at the wall are represented as an array of `points` on a 2D plane.

Return the maximum number of points that are within or lie on **any** circular dartboard of radius `r`.

**Example 1**:

![ex1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/29/sample_1_1806.png)

```txt
Input: points = [[-2,0],[2,0],[0,2],[0,-2]], r = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Circle dartboard with center in (0,0) and radius = 2 contain all points.
```

**Example 2**:

![ex2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/29/sample_2_1806.png)

```txt
Input: points = [[-3,0],[3,0],[2,6],[5,4],[0,9],[7,8]], r = 5
Output: 5
Explanation: Circle dartboard with center in (0,4) and radius = 5 contain all points except the point (7,8).
```

**Example 3**:

```txt
Input: points = [[-2,0],[2,0],[0,2],[0,-2]], r = 1
Output: 1
```

**Example 4**:

```txt
Input: points = [[1,2],[3,5],[1,-1],[2,3],[4,1],[1,3]], r = 2
Output: 4
```

**Constraints**:

* `1 <= points.length <= 100`
* `points[i].length == 2`
* `-10^4 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 10^4`
* `1 <= r <= 5000`

> Hint:
>
> * If there is an optimal solution, you can always move the circle so that two points lie on the boundary of the circle.
> * When the radius is fixed, you can find either 0 or 1 or 2 circles that pass two given points at the same time.
> * Loop for each pair of points and find the center of the circle, after that count the number of points inside the circle.
