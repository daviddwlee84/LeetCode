# Priority Queue and Binary Heap

## Concept

> [Difference between Priority-Queue and Heap, and C++ implementation - LeetCode Discuss](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/discuss/10527/Difference-between-Priority-Queue-and-Heap-and-C%2B%2B-implementation)

1. `Heap` is a kind of data structure. It is a name for a particular way of storing data that makes certain operations very efficient. We can use a tree or array to describe it.

    ```txt
        18
       /  \
      10   16
     / \   / \
    9  5  8  12

    18, 10, 16, 9, 5, 8, 12
    ```

2. `Priority queue` is an abstract datatype. It is a shorthand way of describing a particular interface and behavior, and says nothing about the underlying implementation.

A `heap` is a very good data structure to implement a `priority queue`. The operations which are made efficient by the heap data structure are the operations that the `priority queue` interface needs.
