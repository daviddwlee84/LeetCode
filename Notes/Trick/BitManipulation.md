# Bit Manipulation Trick

## Shift for multiply and divide

* `a // 2` is equivalent to `a >> 1`
* `a * 2` is equivalent to `a << 1`
* `a ** n` is equivalent to `a << n`

Example:

Binary search find mid `low + high >> 1` (you can save time of typing the bracket)

## Determine even or odds

* `a % 2` is equivalent to `a & 1`
