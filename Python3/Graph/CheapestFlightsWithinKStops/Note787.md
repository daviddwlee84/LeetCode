# 787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops

## Description

There are `n` cities connected by `m` flights. Each flight starts from city `u` and arrives at `v` with a price `w`.

Now given all the cities and flights, together with starting city `src` and the destination `dst`, your task is to find the cheapest price from `src` to `dst` with up to `k` stops. If there is no such route, output `-1`.

**Example 1**:

```txt
Input:
n = 3, edges = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]]
src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
Output: 200
Explanation:
The cheapest price from city 0 to city 2 with at most 1 stop costs 200, as marked red in the picture.
```

The graph looks like this:

**Example 2**:

```txt
Input:
n = 3, edges = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]]
src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0
Output: 500
Explanation:
The cheapest price from city 0 to city 2 with at most 0 stop costs 500, as marked blue in the picture.
```

The graph looks like this:

**Constraints**:

* The number of nodes `n` will be in range `[1, 100]`, with nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`.
* The size of `flights` will be in range `[0, n * (n - 1) / 2]`.
* The format of each flight will be `(src, dst, price)`.
* The price of each flight will be in the range `[1, 10000]`.
* k is in the range of `[0, n - 1]`.
* There will not be any duplicated flights or self cycles.
