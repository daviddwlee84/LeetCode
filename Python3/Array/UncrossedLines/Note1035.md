# Uncrossed Lines

## Description

> Hint
>
> Think dynamic programming. Given an oracle dp(i,j) that tells us how many lines A[i:], B[j:] [the sequence A[i], A[i+1], ... and B[j], B[j+1], ...] are uncrossed, can we write this as a recursion?

## Note

1. Recursion
2. Top-down DP (Recursion with memorization)
3. Bottom-up DP
4. Bottom-up DP with space optimization
