# 1010. Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60

## Description

In a list of songs, the `i`-th song has a duration of `time[i]` seconds.

Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by `60`.  Formally, we want the number of indices `i`, `j` such that `i` < `j` with `(time[i]+ time[j]) % 60 == 0`.

**Example 1**:

```txt
Input: [30,20,150,100,40]
Output: 3
Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
(time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
(time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
(time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60
```

**Example 2**:

```txt
Input: [60,60,60]
Output: 3
Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.
```

**Note**:

* `1 <= time.length <= 60000`
* `1 <= time[i] <= 500`

What if the "pairs" contain 3 time?

                    count -= 1

        return count // 2
```

    def numPairsDivisibleBy60(self, time: List[int]) -> int:
        counter = Counter()
        for i in range(len(time)):
            time[i] %= 60
            counter[time[i]] += 1

        for t in time:
            if 60 - t in counter:
                # prefix sum
