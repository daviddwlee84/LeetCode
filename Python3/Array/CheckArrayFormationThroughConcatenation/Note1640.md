# 1640. Check Array Formation Through Concatenation

## Description

You are given an array of **distinct** integers `arr` and an array of integer arrays `pieces`, where the integers in `pieces` are **distinct**. Your goal is to form `arr` by concatenating the arrays in `pieces` **in any order**. However, you are **not** allowed to reorder the integers in each array `pieces[i]`.

Return `true` *if it is possible to form the array* `arr` *from* `pieces`. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1**:

```txt
Input: arr = [85], pieces = [[85]]
Output: true
```

**Example 2**:

```txt
Input: arr = [15,88], pieces = [[88],[15]]
Output: true
Explanation: Concatenate [15] then [88]
```

**Example 3**:

```txt
Input: arr = [49,18,16], pieces = [[16,18,49]]
Output: false
Explanation: Even though the numbers match, we cannot reorder pieces[0].
```

**Example 4**:

```txt
Input: arr = [91,4,64,78], pieces = [[78],[4,64],[91]]
Output: true
Explanation: Concatenate [91] then [4,64] then [78]
```

**Example 5**:

```txt
Input: arr = [1,3,5,7], pieces = [[2,4,6,8]]
Output: false
```

**Constraints**:

* `1 <= pieces.length <= arr.length <= 100`
* `sum(pieces[i].length) == arr.length`
* `1 <= pieces[i].length <= arr.length`
* `1 <= arr[i], pieces[i][j] <= 100`
* The integers in `arr` are **distinct**.
* The integers in `pieces` are **distinct** (i.e., If we flatten pieces in a 1D array, all the integers in this array are distinct).

## Solution

### Permutation

> TLE

* Combine all pieces in all kinds of ways

### DFS

* Try to remove pieces in arr from left to right, until all the pieces have been used or can't find proper piece

### Hash Table

> Much tricky

* Record the first item of the piece, and iterate through the arr and try to concatenate the piece and see if it is equal to original arr
