# 139. Word Break

## Description

Given a **non-empty** string s and a dictionary *wordDict* containing a list of **non-empty** words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

**Note**:

The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

**Example 1**:

```txt
Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet", "code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
```

**Example 2**:

```txt
Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
             Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
```

**Example 3**:

```txt
Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]
Output: false
```
