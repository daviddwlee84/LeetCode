# 344. Reverse String

## Description

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `char[]`.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of [printable ascii characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).

**Example 1**:

```txt
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

**Example 2**:

```txt
Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

> Hint:
>
> The entire logic for reversing a string is based on using the opposite directional two-pointer approach!
