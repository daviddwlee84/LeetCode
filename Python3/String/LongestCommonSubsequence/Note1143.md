# 1143. Longest Common Subsequence

## Description

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

**Example 1**:

```txt
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 2**:

```txt
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 3**:

```txt
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```

**Constraints**:

* `1 <= text1.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= text2.length <= 1000`
* The input strings consist of lowercase English characters only.

> Finding LCS is a kind of DP algorithm that rules out subproblems based on conditions in the problem

Notation:

* define the *i*th **prefix** of $X$ as $X_i = \langle x_1, x_2, \dots, x_i \rangle$, and $X_0$ is the empty sequence

**Theorem**: [Optimal substructure](../../../Notes/Algorithm/DynamicProgramming.md#Optimal-Substructure) of an LCS

Let $X = \langle x_1, x_2, \dots, x_m \rangle$ and $Y = \langle y_1, y_2, \dots, y_m \rangle$ be sequences, and
let $Z = \langle z_1, z_2, \dots, z_m \rangle$ be any LCS of $X$ and $Y$

1. If $x_m = y_n$ then $z_k = x_m = y_n$ and $Z_{k-1}$ is an LCS of $X_{m-1}$ and $Y_{n-1}$
2. If $x_m \neq y_n$ then $z_k \neq x_m = y_n$ and $Z$ is an LCS of $X_{m-1}$ and $Y$
3. If $x_m \neq y_n$ then $z_k \neq y_n = y_n$ and $Z$ is an LCS of $X$ and $Y_{n-1}$

infer =>

1. an LCS of two sequences contains within it an LCS of prefixes of the two sequences => LCS problem has an optimal-substructure property
2. recursive solution has the overlapping-subproblems property

## Solution

### Brute Force

Enumerate all subsequences of X and check each subsequence to see whether it is also a subsequence of Y

* Time Complexity: $O(2^m)$

### Dynamic Programming

* Time Complexity: $O(m \times n)$

Steps:

1. Characterizing a longest common subsequence
   1. find optimal structure of an LCS
   2. check the overlapping-subproblem property
2. Recursive solution
3. Computing the length of an LCS
   1. use table "c" to count
   2. use table "b" to backtrack
4. Constructing an LCS
   1. use table "b" to backtrack
