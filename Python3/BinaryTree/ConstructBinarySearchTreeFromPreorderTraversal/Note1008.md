# 1008. Construct Binary Search Tree from Preorder Traversal

## Description

Return the root node of a binary **search** tree that matches the given `preorder` traversal.

(Recall that a binary search tree is a binary tree where for every node, any descendant of node.left has a value < node.val, and any descendant of node.right has a value > node.val.  Also recall that a preorder traversal displays the value of the node first, then traverses node.left, then traverses node.right.)

It's guaranteed that for the given test cases there is always possible to find a binary search tree with the given requirements.

**Example 1**:

```txt
Input: [8,5,1,7,10,12]
Output: [8,5,10,1,7,null,12]
```

**Constraints**:

* `1 <= preorder.length <= 100`
* `1 <= preorder[i] <= 10^8`
* The values of `preorder` are distinct.

## Solution

### Transfer to Construct Tree from Preorder and Sorted Inorder

### Recursive Build Subtree seperated by the Root
