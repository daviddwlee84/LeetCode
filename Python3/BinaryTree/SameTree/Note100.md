# 100. Same Tree

## Description

Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

**Example 1**:

```txt
Input:     1         1
          / \       / \
         2   3     2   3

        [1,2,3],   [1,2,3]

Output: true
```

**Example 2**:

```txt
Input:     1         1
          /           \
         2             2

        [1,2],     [1,null,2]

Output: false
```

**Example 3**:

```txt
Input:     1         1
          / \       / \
         2   1     1   2

        [1,2,1],   [1,1,2]

Output: false
```

## Solution

### Transfer it into list and compare the list

### Compare the tree recursively
