# 94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal

## Descripton

Given a binary tree, return the *inorder* traversal of its nodes' values.

**Example**:

```
Input: [1,null,2,3]
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3

Output: [1,3,2]
```

**Follow up**: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?


## Solution

### Recursive


### Iterative

* Stack

1. Push all left subtree into stack
2. Pop from stack and visit it
3. Go to right subtree
