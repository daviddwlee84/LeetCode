# 687. Longest Univalue Path

## Description

Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest path where each node in the path has the same value. This path may or may not pass through the root.

**Note**: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

**Example 1**:

Input:
```
              5
             / \
            4   5
           / \   \
          1   1   5
```
Output:
```
2
```
**Example 2**:

Input:
```
              1
             / \
            4   5
           / \   \
          4   4   5
```
Output:
```
2
```
**Note**: The given binary tree has not more than 10000 nodes. The height of the tree is not more than 1000.
