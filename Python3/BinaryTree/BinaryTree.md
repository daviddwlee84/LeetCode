# Binary Tree

## Introduction

A **tree** is a frequently-used data structure to simulate a hierarchical tree structure.

Each node of the tree will have a root value and a list of references to other nodes which are called child nodes. From graph view, a tree can also be defined as a directed acyclic graph which has **N nodes** and **N-1 edges**.

A **Binary Tree** is one of the most typical tree structure. As the name suggests, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has **at most two children**, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

By completing this card, you will be able to:

1. Understand the concept of a **tree** and a **binary tree**;
2. Be familiar with different **traversal** methods;
3. Use **recursion** to solve binary-tree-related problems;

## Traverse a Tree

### Pre-order Traversal

Pre-order traversal is to visit the root first. Then traverse the left subtree. Finally, traverse the right subtree.

### In-order Traversal

In-order traversal is to traverse the left subtree first. Then visit the root. Finally, traverse the right subtree.

### Post-order Traversal

Post-order traversal is to traverse the left subtree first. Then traverse the right subtree. Finally, visit the root.
